## Description
This is a Work Day Scheduler that utilizes JQuery, Bootstrap and Days.js to allow a user to input and save items into an itinerary.

The code was delivered without complete HTML or logic to allow functionality. Now, the JQuery generates rows of HTML to input and save itinerary items in, Days.js displays the current time and date at the top, and the rows automatically change their format based on their relationship to current time.


## Current Bugs
*The clear itinerary button works in Live Server but not in deployed webpage.

## Installation
The website is accessible at the links below. You can navigate there with any functional web browser. The website should apper as in the image below:

![The deployed website matches the mock-up provided in the service ticket. ](./assets/screencapture.png)



## Usage
Navigate to the webpage. Fill in the columns with itinerary items and to-dos, then press the save button to make your input persist.
